Complex system
: \hspace{20cm} There are several definitions. Here are some that I found to be of use:

* "Systems that don't yield to compact forms of representation or description" (David Krakauer apud @mitchell2013);
* "A system of many interacting parts where the system is more than just the sum of its parts" (Mark Newman apud @mitchell2013);
* Systems with many connected agents that interact and exhibit self-organization and emergence behavior, all without the need for a central controller (adapted from Camilo Rodrigues Neto's);
* Dialectics at its finest (Daniel's working definition).
